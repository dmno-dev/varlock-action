## Installation

You'll need, at minimum, node 22 and pnpm 10+ installed.

We recommend using [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to manage node versions. If you use `fnm` with [`corepack`](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack) you can run `corepack enable` to enable pnpm and you should be good to go.

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

test:

```bash
pnpm test
```
